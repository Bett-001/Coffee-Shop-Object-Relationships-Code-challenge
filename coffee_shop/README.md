#Coffee Shop Object Relationships

By Tonny Bett

This project is a Python object-oriented programming exercise that models a simple coffee shop system. It focuses on creating and managing the relationships between three core classes: Customer, Coffee, and Order. The goal is to practice class design, validations, and object relationships using clean and organized Python code.

The system allows customers to place orders for different coffee types, each order storing its customer, coffee, and price. From these objects, you can retrieve useful information such as all orders for a coffee, all coffees a customer has tried, and a customer’s average spending.

#Features#

Create customers with validated names

Create coffees with validated names

Create orders linking a customer and a coffee

Retrieve related data such as:

A coffee’s orders and customers

A customer’s orders and coffees
